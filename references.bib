Here we report the results of a preregistered replication attempt of Experiment 2 from Topolinski and Sparenberg (2012). Participants turned kitchen rolls either clockwise or counterclockwise while answering items from a questionnaire assessing openness to experience. Data from 102 participants showed that the effect went slightly in the direction opposite to that predicted by Topolinski and Sparenberg (2012), and a preregistered Bayes factor hypothesis test revealed that the data were 10.76 times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis. Our findings illustrate the theoretical importance and practical advantages of preregistered Bayes factor replication studies, both for psychological science and for empirical work in general.},

In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional R will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

In particular, null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and its p value have been ubiquitous in published research for decades. Much more recently, null hypothesis Bayesian testing (NHBT) and its Bayes factor have also started to become more commonplace in applied research. Following preliminary work by Wong and colleagues, we investigated how, and to what extent, researchers misapply the Bayes factor in applied psychological research by means of a literature study. Based on a final sample of 167 articles, our results indicate that, not unlike NHST and the  p  value, the use of NHBT and the Bayes factor also shows signs of misconceptions. We consider the root causes of the identified problems and provide suggestions to improve the current state of affairs. This article is aimed to assist researchers in drawing the best inferences possible while using NHBT and the Bayes factor in applied research.},

Hence, so-called open-label placebos (OLPs) offer a new way to harness placebo effects ethically. To take this concept one step further, this study aimed at evaluating placebo effects without the use of a physical placebo, i.e., by imagining taking a pill. Healthy students (N\,=\,173) with self-reported test anxiety were either randomized to an imaginary pill (IP; n\,=\,55), an OLP (n\,=\,59) or a control group (CG; n\,=\,59). Both intervention groups were instructed to take two pills daily for three weeks. Primary outcome was test anxiety, secondary outcomes were sleep quality, general well-being and test performance. Groups test anxiety differed at study-endpoint, F(2,169)\,=\,11.50, p\,{$<$}\,.001. Test anxiety was lower in the intervention groups compared to the CG, t(169)\,=\,-\,4.44, p\,{$<$}\,.001, d\,=\,-\,0.71. The interventions did not differ significantly, i.e., both were similarly efficacious, t(169)\,=\,0.61, p\,=\,.540, d\,=\,0.11. The interaction between group and time in explaining test anxiety was significant, F(5,407.93)\,=\,6.13, p\,{$<$}\,.001. OLPs and IPs reduced test anxiety in healthy participants compared to the CG. This finding opens the door for a novel and ethical method to harness placebo effects.},

Bayesian statistics is often promoted as an ideal substitute for frequentists statistics since it coincides better with researchers' expectations and needs. A particular incidence of this is the proposal of replacing Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) by Null Hypothesis Bayesian Testing (NHBT) using the Bayes factor. In this paper, it is studied to what extent the usability and expectations of NHBT match well. First, a study of the reporting practices in 73 psychological publications was carried out. It was found that eight Questionable Reporting and Interpreting Practices (QRIPs) occur more than once among the practitioners when doing NHBT. Specifically, our analysis provides insight into possible mismatches and their occurrence frequencies. A follow-up survey study has been conducted to assess such mismatches. The sample (N = 108) consisted of psychology researchers, experts in methodology (and/or statistics), and applied researchers in fields other than psychology. The data show that discrepancies exist among the participants. Interpreting the Bayes Factor as posterior odds and not acknowledging the notion of relative evidence in the Bayes Factor are arguably the most concerning ones. The results of the paper suggest that a shift of statistical paradigm cannot solve the problem of misinterpretation altogether if the users are not well acquainted with the tools.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

We revisit JAB01 and introduce a piecewise transformation that clarifies the connection to the frequentist two-sided p-value. Specifically, if p {$\leq$} .10 then JAB01 {$\approx$} 3p{$\surd$}n; if .10 \&lt; p {$\leq$} .50 then JAB01 {$\approx$} {$\surd$}(pn); and if p \&gt; .50 then JAB01 {$\approx$} p\^(1/4){$\surd$}n. These transformation rules present p-value practitioners with a straightforward opportunity to obtain Bayesian benefits such as the ability to monitor evidence as data accumulate without reaching a foregone conclusion. Using the JAB01 framework we derive simple and accurate approximate Bayes factors for the t-test, the binomial test, the comparison of two proportions, and the correlation test.},

This decision rule focuses on the range of plausible values indicated by the highest density interval of the posterior distribution and the relation between this range and a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) around the null value. The article also discusses considerations for setting the limits of a ROPE and emphasizes that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds for p values and Bayes factors.},

But ineffectively designed visualizations can cause confusion, misunderstanding, or even distrust---especially among viewers with low graphical literacy. We review research-backed guidelines for creating effective and intuitive visualizations oriented toward communicating data to students, coworkers, and the general public. We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication, provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience.},

In Study 1, 40 teachers assessed four visualization types displaying six effect sizes. Half-eye plots were perceived as less challenging and more informative compared to raincloud and Gardner--Altman plots. However, misconceptions of U               3               and overlap were prevalent across all types. In Study 2, enrichment options (signaling, benchmarking) integrated into half-eye plots were examined for their impact on, among others, understanding and misconception reduction. While benchmarks increased time needed for decision-making, they did not improve accuracy compared to a control group and neither did signaling. However, both signaling options substantially reduced misconceptions. Furthermore, one signaling option increased participants' sensitivity to group differences. This study offers first indications of a promising visualization type, the half-eye plot, and an enrichment option to decrease misconceptions when considering visualization design in science communication efforts aimed at supporting educators.},

  abstract = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.''

  abstract = {A key component of scientific communication is sufficient information for other researchers in the field to reproduce published findings. For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (               i               ) requesting data and code from authors and (               ii               ) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal               Science               after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%. We find this policy---author remission of data and code postpublication upon request---an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},
